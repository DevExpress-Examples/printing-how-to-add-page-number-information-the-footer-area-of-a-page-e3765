' Developer Express Code Central Example:
' Printing: How to add page number information the footer area of a page
' 
' This example shows how to add a page number to every page when printing a
' DXGrid. You'll need to prepare a custom page footer template and place a
' TextEdit control that will display the current page number within it. Note that
' the TextEdit should be properly adjusted by setting required dxp:ExportSettings
' (http://documentation.devexpress.com/#WPF/DevExpressXpfPrintingExportSettingsMembersTopicAll),
' dxp:PageNumberExportSettings.Kind
' (http://documentation.devexpress.com/#WPF/DevExpressXpfPrintingPageNumberExportSettings_Kindtopic)
' and dxp:PageNumberExportSettings.Format
' (http://documentation.devexpress.com/#WPF/DevExpressXpfPrintingPageNumberExportSettings_Formattopic)
' properties. Next, assign this custom page footer template to the
' PrintableControlLink.PageFooterTemplate property during export.
